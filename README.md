# Advanced Face Analysis System ðŸ”¬

An interactive web application for advanced facial recognition and analysis, developed as a final project for the "Advanced Topics in Data Mining" course. This system identifies individuals from a custom, high-quality database built from the LFW dataset and provides a rich, real-time analysis of the input image.

* **Advanced Feature Analysis:** Provides real-time estimations for:
    * **Age & Gender**
    * **Facial Landmarks Visualization**
* **Interactive Web UI:** A polished and user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, featuring:
    * An intuitive image uploader.
    * A dynamic image gallery displaying all database photos of a recognized individual.
    * A configurable confidence threshold slider to tune the system's sensitivity.
* **High-Quality Database:** Utilizes a custom-filtered version of the renowned **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)** dataset, ensuring a robust and challenging benchmark based on the "quality over quantity" principle.
